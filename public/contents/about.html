      <h3>NFCS Daily Psalm</h3>
      <h4>Psalm 16. A prayer of confidence.</h4>
      <blockquote class="dailyVerse">
        <p>
          Protect me, Oh God, I trust in you for safety, I say to the Lord, "You
          are my Lord all the good things I have come from you"
        </p>
        <p>
          How excellent are the Lord's faithful people! My greatest pleasure to
          be with them, those who rush to other gods, bring many troubles on
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will not take part in their libation; I will not worship their gods.
          You Lord, are all I have, and you give me all I need; My future is in
          your hands. How wonderful are your gifts to me; How good they are!
        </p>
        <p>
          I praise the Lord, because he guides me, and in the night my
          conscience warns me. I am always aware of the Lord's presence; He is
          near, and nothing can shake me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so, I am thankful and glad, and I feel completely secured, because
          you protect me from the power of death. I have served you faithfully,
          and you will not abandon me to the world of the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will show me the path that leads to life; Your presence fills me
          with joy.

      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>
        Holy Family Chaplaincy (HFC) AE-FUNAI started in 2012 as a result of a
        collaboratory effort of some student and staff of the institution to
        gather the catholic students and unite as a family after the full
        establishment of the institution in November 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group of persons went forward to inviting parish priest of St.
        Anthony's Catholic Church Ndufu-Echara, Rev. Fr. Peter Agbo who is
        currently our chaplain for the celebration of the first holy mass in
        AE-FUNAI, which was on the 8th of November, 2012 at about 5pm at the
        university auditorium with a good number of students in attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rev. Fr. Peter Agbo also admonished the students to organise themselves
        and elect an executive body to run the affairs of the catholic students
        in the institution and helped them to elect the first executives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another major exercise that took place on the same day of the election
        was naming of our new chaplaincy in AE-FUNAI. Amongst the suggestions
        made, after careful deliberations and divinely direction, the name "HOLY
        FAMILY" came to stay, hence: "NFCS Holy Family Chaplaincy AE-FUNAI"
        Chapter
      </p>
      <p>
        Liturgical and pious organizations were further introduced in the
        chaplaincy by students who were members of the various pious societies
        before being AE-FUNAI students.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chaplaincy has grown from strength to strength by the special grace
        of God on the chaplaincy its members, the executives and the chaplain
        amidst the challenges.
